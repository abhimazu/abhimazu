### Bio

👨🏻‍💻 Currently, I am building TransformerLab, an open source toolkit to train and evaluate LLMs. My primary skill is to convert POCs into production-grade systems. Previously, I was the Head of MLOps @ Binoloop and before that, I was part of the IOTG Customer Solutions and Developer Enabling group at Intel, where I specialized in designing AI applications and pipelines that optimize deployment for a wide range of applications including Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision and Time-series analytics. Throughout my career, I have worked on architecting various applications and frameworks that enables easy configuration and optimize performance.

🌱 I'm currently pursuing an initiative "Industrodrome" that has projects related to AI, ML and Cloud Deployment along with aggregating research problems in the industry and helping learners to apply their learnings to solve real-world problems by contributing to open source community. 

🎓 I received my Masters in Electrical Engineering with a specialization in Systems and Controls from Indian Institue of Technology Roorkee and a Post Graduate Diploma from Purdue University in AI and ML.
